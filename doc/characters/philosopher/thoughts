- we use the power of language to maintain collective adherence to a narrative
- there is a matter of boundry we have in our heads that define the objects to which we refer
- the birds, the squirrels, deer, the trees, even, don't understand what we're all so enamoured of. they don't understand that what we have our heads/attention up inside is a vastly complex field of information. they just see high energy and high frequency phenomenon occuring. perhaps it would be a worthwhile endeavor to try to elucidate the translations between these levels of phenomena.

underneath everything is a mantra. is a heartbeat a mantra? what good is a mantra that imbues confusion? what is underneath the mantra? could it crumble, too?
the battle of the mantras.
- i was thinking about how everyone is under the influence of some substance, riding out the progression of effects, and operating under a pattern of obtaining the next fix. most of these substances sedate, subdue us. they keep us at a low energy level, easier to monitor and control, so that we won't be any trouble to the other groups of people who want to keep power over us in the happenings of the physical situation.
- the fact of the matter is that we live on these different levels of reality.  
- so it seems there are two main paradigms by which a human lives its life. it is either to seek out the pleasures he wants to experience, or it is by surrending his desire and ego and letting the will of others carry him along. with the former, the design of human conduct comes from within and is defined by the mind of the human. with the latter, the design of human conduct comes from external nature and is defined by the edges of the boundaries between what is external and internal to the humans.
- and so i see how egos are held together within a collective paradigm through time, depending on the syntax and semantics of their language and the rhythm and rhyme.
