- we use the power of language to maintain collective adherence to a narrative
- there is a matter of boundry we have in our heads that define the objects to which we refer
- the birds, the squirrels, deer, the trees, even, don't understand what we're all so enamoured of. they don't understand that what we have our heads/attention up inside is a vastly complex field of information. they just see high energy and high frequency phenomenon occuring. perhaps it would be a worthwhile endeavor to try to elucidate the translations between these levels of phenomena.

the new medium upon which the mind resides.
underneath everything is a mantra. is a heartbeat a mantra? what good is a mantra that imbues confusion? what is underneath the mantra? could it crumble, too?
the battle of the mantras.
- i was thinking about how everyone is under the influence of some substance, riding out the progression of effects, and operating under a pattern of obtaining the next fix. most of these substances sedate, subdue us. they keep us at a low energy level, easier to monitor and control, so that we won't be any trouble to the other groups of people who want to keep power over us in the happenings of the physical situation.
- the fact of the matter is that we live on these different levels of reality.  
- so it seems there are two main paradigms by which a human lives its life. it is either to seek out the pleasures he wants to experience, or it is by surrending his desire and ego and letting the will of others carry him along. with the former, the design of human conduct comes from within and is defined by the mind of the human. with the latter, the design of human conduct comes from external nature and is defined by the edges of the boundaries between what is external and internal to the humans.
- and so i see how egos are held together within a collective paradigm through time, depending on the syntax and semantics of their language and the rhythm and rhyme
- we have faith in the cultural groundwork laid down before us. what when that groundwork seems to begin to crumble? the collective mind forgets every now and then, through the ages, that that structure demands responsible participation from its members.
- i see tyrrany on every god damn level of phenomenon. i see it in my own mind, how i control my own actions, how i allocate thought and time to different matters.
- as i use these artificats of existing culture(s) as pointers to strange concepts floating out their in the realm of potential possibility. 
- as i use the best cultural artificats of times past to help push me through the work of my time, to continue the story, to fight to justify my existence -- the madness which propels us all -- to say that "i'm more than mere fish swimming through an unknown sea chasing after bite after bite!", however true i fear it may be. 
    - and the meta-awareness leaves me frozen in time as concepts seem to uncoil before my minds eye in an infinite antagonistic charade  
        - the void awakens, calls in the distance
- difference of species: what if species could share in some experience of eternal bliss and understanding?
- the language was a tool, but now it has evolved to be a weapon, or a defense mechanism, to defend against healing change.
- we live in a field of information suspended in an abstract space. we suffer from mental issues. we are a strange species because we are aware of so much, and we have transformed the landscapes of earth so much. everyday we wake up into this world, and babies are born into this.
- are we just sitting around, avoiding responsibility, waiting for our next goody that this world is supposed to provide us?
- is this what we do for technology? deny our humanity? 

to engineer:
    - so what of this? what of this perfect world you envision? what will come of this tremendous efficiency? what is the end goal? what matters will truly occupy people's minds?

what will the final thought be? [what will be the final thought of man?]
what realization will cease the need for language in its current form to remain in use?


i can't stop from thinking about where this is all going. this whole "project of humanity" -- that's how i will refer to the general collective situation with which most humans are concerned. is there some "core" to "semantic processing"? and would its grokking lead to a singularity?

it seems like the door is open to transform, to catalyze the process that would initiate a phase shift -- to transition the current saturated system into a super-saturated state, or to expand the forces which define the underlying physical relationships to one of greater coherance and stability (because currently there is too much chaos riding along the "surface" (a term i will use to refer to present understanding of all phenomenah underlying everything that has been perceived)). however, there is a will to cling on to the existing form. it's like a wind is coming to pick up a flock of birds to help them fly, but they want to stay on the ground and partake in the pleasures of their current lifestyle.
