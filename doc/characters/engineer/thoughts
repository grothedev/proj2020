- so we have quite the task ahead of us if we are to use our ingenuity to make society scientifically-up-to-date.. quite the task. the motions ahead will be huge. we will transform ecosystems, landscapes, plant plants where there was concrete and forests will thrive, new transportation and communications networks, ecologically-harmonious waste disposal. what do we want the future of society to look like? what are our values? what will the economy be like, if there even will be one? we must think outside the box here, truly. we're allowed to do that
- imagine this: you wake up in the morning, do your morning routing, check out the community garden which you share with 10-40 people who live next to you, you are not bothered by the noise of car engines because there are no cars in the residential area you live in. you walk to the maglev/hyperloop train station which will be waiting for you just at the right time because you have entered into the system on your phone that you will need a ride at 8am. the payment is handled automatically by your digital proof-of-work stored in your phone, home computers, and the greater blockchain used by everyone else. while riding on the train, you check your phone to see that there a few new policies being considered for your jurisdiction (only the ones that you are concerned about, such as education or when music can happen at the public square). you vote on the issues of concern and contribute your thoughts to the discussion. while at work, your monetary status is updated (a value whose energetic impact on the physical surroundings ebbs and flows depending on where you are geographically and what the resource situation is like there at the present time). 
- we are faced with a question of how to make the best use of the tools, knowledge, skills, and energy we have access to. it is clear that we cannot depend on the existing system (school -> job -> economic actor) to automatically "plug us in" to the best role, without at least some thinking on our part. this may be true for some, but not all. the next question is how exactly does one come to find what the "best" role is? to answer that requires a deep analysis of fundamental values and conceptions of reality. but i think a fair starting point to define the "ideal role" is the following: "something that transitions the economic system to be modelled after a more accurate representation of the material reality within which it is embedded (or upon which it resides, however you want to think about it), and takes into account the implied limitations. thus it does not take 'constant accumulation of potential' to be the assumed goal of each actor at all times, but rather takes on more of a wave-like form, accepting that it might too be bound to the same cyclical patterns which govern every single other known ordered-system (e.g. life) which has been generated by the laws of physics thus far." 
- to continue on previous point, with this new economic paradigm the new technology should be much easier to implement, even on scale.
- so what we're dealing with here is an extremely complex system, and it needs to be carefully oriented and configured so that it can launch off and function with the most benefit and minimum detriment. if it's not eriented properly, chaos will surely ensue. there is a small window of time within which it is even possible to configure it, and there are hefty forces constantly battling against its realization.
