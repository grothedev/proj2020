neglecting time,
the warmth, setting of the sun,
rotating earth and orbitting galaxies,
for containerized experiences
packaged up within their physical mediums,
having been engineered by our scientists
to play out the pre-programmed show
upon the command of the we the consumer.

we who have narrowed our range of consciousness
yet pinpointed and concentrated it so much
on such a potent conglomerate of information,
(so tightly packed)
another dataset to float through the ether,

somehow deep faith emerged in this,
time and suffering no longer,
physical space just a label for an indifferet, meaningless, empty perception
that passes us by while we configure our next dataset.

all day pulling words from a cosmic void
from the form of the air which he breathes.

dancing man packaged and frozen,
still the same old tv dinner serial killer though,

what's that? you've discovered the mechanics of entropy?
derived the laws and wrote it down?

and when you have dreams like that,
thinkin on a timescale like that

i don't care about the material world,
my mind's flying through dreams and fantasies
and i know of all the suffering and pain going on around,
but i just can't care about it when i was just dropped here not too long ago.
i'm tryin to get back to my soul
