day one:
    - i dreamed of that all-consuming void of reality again last night. i woke up into the silence and all i could see in my mind's eye was a great beast sprawling the entire ocean with its tentacles the size of skyskrapers laying upon the shores of every continent. this beast was as massive as the earth itself and showed just that there is no real solid ground, as it sought to consume the planet.
