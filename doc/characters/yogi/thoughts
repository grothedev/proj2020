- so what we have to deal with here is the human mind. the perceptual experience presented to our consciousness is a result of the "world" we inhabit, but the possibilities of what energy comes to us is continually affected by the decisions we make each day, and we create the world together each day. would it do one any good to be so completely absorbed in his own work?
- you must ask yourself 'what are the first thoughts that come to my mind upon waking?'. what is your fundamental drive each day? where do you fit within this field of conscious energy? 
- the thing about the question presented by [philosopher] is the fact that my view of my ego is constantly changing day by day or even moment by moment. so i do live to serve others, or god. but this is only a process of god discovering himself. it is a process of the divine mind exploring its own boundaries and form.
