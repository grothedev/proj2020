volunteers to help the poor as a main activity. does not identify with ego, though still has one and uses it as an interface to interact with members of human society (and his own thoughts). follows a strict yoga routine to purify his mind and soul, as he is on a path of ridding himself of attachments/desire to be one with an omnipresent all-knowing universal consciousness (god).
